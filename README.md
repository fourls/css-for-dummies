# CSS for Dummies
This project is a Node script that accepts the input of a valid CSS file (.css), and outputs a HTML file that details what the styles applied to the elements mean.

## Usage
In order to run this project, you will need to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Once you have installed Node, run the command `node /path/to/main.js`. Follow the prompts, specifying an input and output file, and your CSS file will be translated.
